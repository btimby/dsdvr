Dead Simple DVR Viewer
======================

The viewer is a simple GUI that displays the guide grid and allows the user to
view live TV or records (although in practice the viewer always views
recordings).

There are two main UI "screens". The guide grid and the video viewer. There is
also a mini viewer superimposed on the guide grid, so the user can easily
resume viewing or view something else.
